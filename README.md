# Phrase-Guesser game

## How To Play

The game starts when the user clicks on the "Start Game" button.

You win by correctly guessing the phrase (letter by letter).

Every wrong guess leads to the loss of a heart. Lose 5 and the game is over.

There are two ways to input your guesses:

1. By clicking the on-screen buttons or
2. Directly typing it on your keyboard

Keep in mind the phrases include quotes and sayings from popular anime, movies, and tv-series

###### _Since the code lacks security, you can take a look at the generated phrase using the browser inspector (this will be patched in the future, probably)_
